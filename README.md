# PZ Server

The Photo-z (PZ) Server is one of the Brazilian in-kind contributions offered by the Laborat√≥rio Interinstitucional de e-Astronomia (LIneA) to the PZ Coordination Group from Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Data Management (DM) Team. Inspired by features of the DES Science Portal (Gschwend et al., 2018; Fausti Neto et al., 2018), the PZ Server is being planned to be an online service, complementary to the Rubin Science Platform (RSP), to host PZ-related lightweight data products and to offer data management tools that allow sharing data products among RSP users, attach and share relevant metadata, and help on provenance tracking.
